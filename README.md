## Pomomo
Pomodoro Discord Bot
__________
Pomomo is a Discord bot that will join your voice channel and play an alert whenever your pomodoro or break is over. You'll be able to keep track of the session through the text channel Pomomo was started from or in your DMs if you're subscribed to the session.

Pomomo was inspired by a need to balance productivity and socializing. Designate time to focus so everyone can get stuff done while hanging out! You can customize the duration of any of the intervals.
